<p class="head">I.  Downloading<a name="dl"></a></p>
<p class="indent">You can always find the latest version of CSDM as a package at the <a href="http://www.amxmodx.org/">AMX Mod X</a> forums, in the <a href="http://www.amxmodx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=346">CSDM Plugin Thread</a>.
<p class="indent">The source code is available in full in its <a href="http://www.tcwonline.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/dvander/amxmodx/csdm_amxx/">CVS Repository</a>.
</p>
<p class="head">II. Installing<A name=install></A></p>
<p class="indent">CSDM Mod requires <a href="http://www.amxmodx.org/">AMX Mod X 1.60</a> or higher. Most plugins will require the Engine and CSTRIKE modules enabled. It was designed to run on Counter-Strike and will not work on any other mod (except  Condition Zero).
<p class="indent">To install the mod, follow these directions:
<ol>
 <li>Upload/copy the contents of the configs folder (csdm.cfg and the csdm folder containing the map spawn files) to your amxmodx/configs folder on your server.</li>
 <li>Upload the contents of the plugins folder to amxmodx/plugins on your server.</li>
 <li>Upload the contents of the modules folder to amxmodx/modules on your server.</li>
 <li>Add this line to your amxmodx/configs/modules.ini file:
  <pre>
;Counter-Strike Deathmatch Module
csdm_amxx
  </pre>
 </li>
 <li>CSDM comes with a few plugins by default.  You should only add the ones you plan on using:
  <ul>
   <li>csdm_main.amxx - Main plugin, required for most things</li>
   <li>csdm_equip.amxx - Weapons and equipment menus</li>
   <li>csdm_spawn_preset.amxx - Preset spawning (each map must have a spawn file in amxmodx/configs/csdm/)</li>
   <li>spawn_editor.amxx - Edits/creates spawn points for maps</li>
   <li>csdm_misc.amxx - Miscellanious extra features</li>
   <li>csdm_tickets.amxx - Round ticketing (each team only has X number of spawns before they lose)</li>
   <li>csdm_protection.amxx - Sets spawn protection</li>
  </ul>
  For each plugin you wish to use, add their filename to amxmodx/configs/plugins.ini.  It is safe to add plugins you won't use all the time; you can configure their settings and enable/disable them through amxmodx/configs/csdm.cfg.
  </li>
 <li>Add the following line to amxx.cfg or server.cfg:
  <pre>csdm_active 1</pre>
 </li>
 <li>Fully restart your server and you will be ready to go with a default setup!</li>
</ol>
<br />
<p class="head">III. Configuration<A name=howto></A></P>
<p class="indent">Configuration is done entirely through the csdm.cfg file in amxmodx/configs.  <b>These values are NOT cvars!</b>  The csdm.cfg file is a special file that is read and parsed separately so multiple plugins can easily see values in it.  Each value is explained either in the csdm.cfg file or in the documentation provided by the respective plugin.</p>
<p class="head">IV. Commands<A name=cmds></A>

<p class="head">V. Developing/Coding<A name=dev></A></P>
<p class="indent">CSDM 2.0 is modular.  The base portion is a module built to handle and capture primitive events, as well as express things which would be computationally expensive as a plugin.  It is optimized for efficiency. </p>
<p class="indent">The idea behind CSDM 2.0 is rather than including every portion in one plugin, developers can write simple addons, using the basic events provided by the module.  This way using other modules or expensive parsing is often not necessary.  For a full reference of CSDM 2.0's API, you should see csdm.inc in the scripting/include folder of the CSDM download, or view it on CVS: <a href="http://www.tcwonline.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/dvander/amxmodx/csdm_amxx/scripting/include/csdm.inc?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/plain" target="_blank">csdm.inc</a>.  A good example of a simple plugin using the API is csdm_tickets.sma.</p>
<p class="indent">The module automatically respawns players whenever a player joins, a round restarts, or a player dies.  The spawn events allow plugins to interrupt or hook various importat stages in a player's death/revival.  The module makes no attempt to spawn players in a certain location, it simply revives them.  Instead, it allows "spawn handlers" to attach.  The current spawn style handler (set by csdm_main) is notified when it can relocate a player.</p>
<p class="ident">The module handles the following things, notifying plugins:
<ul>
 <li>Round restarts</li>
 <li>Player deaths (you can block respawning)</li>
 <li>Player spawns (both "fake" and "real")</li>
 <li>Configuration file settings</li>
</ul></p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, the module also contains fast routines for common things, such as setting/retrieving player positions, respawning players through the CSDM interface, and removing weapons from the world or players.</p>
