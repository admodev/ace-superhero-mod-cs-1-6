<p class="style2">Why is it called PODBot:</p>
POD is an abbreviation for &quot;<span class="style13">Ping of Death</span>&quot;. It's called that way because it was derived from the &quot;<span class="style13">High Ping Bastard Bot</span>&quot; Botman was doing. And if 
you look at the Bots Ping they always have a Ping of 5 and the very first 
generation of Bots did Headshots all the time! <span class="style14">:P</span>

<p class="style2">The Bots:</p>
<p>The Bots will automatically know the goals of the map. Counter-Terrorists will go for hostages or defuse the bomb, Terrorists will plant the bomb. VIP Bots will try to reach the Rescue Points. The goal selection is done dynamically and will be affected by several factors like Personality, Health, Team-mates near &amp; Items the Bot is carrying. The Bots will also try to support team-mates and take cover when they think it's needed. They can use some buttons like for light-switches and for some doors triggered by the button. It's possible usage of lifts by bots (but it's not recommended - because of the possiblity getting stuck by them in some ways normally not used by human-players) .</p>

<p class="style2"> MODs this Bot supports other than CounterStrike?</p>
<p>PODBot MM supports Steam CounterStrike 1.6 and below, CZERO. Non-Steam CS 1.6 is NOT supported.</p>

<p class="style2">POD-Bot  and CounterStrike: Internet vs LAN </p>
You can join a network game over the Internet or on a LAN without the necessity to uninstall the Bot. You cannot spawn bots when connected to an Internet server unless it is your server that's 
hosted, but you can spawn bots on a LAN if you are running the server (Listenserver).

<p><span class="style2">Waypoints Vs Other Methods</span></p>
<p>Is there a Bot who is doing great without any kind of navigational help like waypoints, wayzones or pre-defined areas?
 It's almost sure you won't find any. The reason for this again is simple. It would just take too much CPU Power to realtime calculate all Geometry inside a map (and it will make too much lags). Imagine a Bot either shooting some dozens of TraceLines (like sonar by submarine) through the part of the map he's seeing or sorting all entity coordinates he encounters. Doesn't matter what he actually does, it was just way too slow for the state of CPU technology, when PODBot was created by CF. You would end up with a Bot which is either pretty good/humanlike at movement but stupid as hell, vice versa or both. <br>
Don't think somebody tells this to discourage Bot authors attempting this. Just try!</p>
