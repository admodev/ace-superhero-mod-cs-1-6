<p class="style2">Latest Release</p>
<p>The latest full version release, which maybe a &#39;.dll&#39; or a &#39;.exe&#39; can be found at the <a href="http://filebase.bots-united.com" class="style11" target="_self">Bots-United
Filebase</a> under the POD-Bot MM category.</p>
<p><a href="http://filebase.bots-united.com/index.php?action=category&id=11" target="_self" class="style11">http://filebase.bots-united.com/pafiledb.php?action=category&id;id=11</a></p>

<p class="style2">Latest Beta .dll</p>
<p>The latest beta version can be found here. It is <span class="style13">work in progress</span> and <span class="style13">not recommended</span> to be used in general unless there was a serious
problem with the latest release or something important was fixed.</p>

<p class="style2">PreSetup Pack</p>
<p>This is a PreSetup pack which you can use if you&#39;ve never installed podbot before and have no idea how to do the install. This will be only available if there is no &#39;.exe&#39; version
available of the podbot and it will override whatever podbot install you have, so backup any&nbsp; files (.txt or .cfg) before running it.</p>

<p class="style2">Steam Client</p>

<p class="style2">Metamod</p>
<p>Metamod is a required plugin for POD-Bot MM to be able to work. It&#39;s a mod, but not your ordinary mod, this mod works between the Half-life game and any plugin like POD-Bot MM or Statsme, you
can have as many plugins as you want, you can even run multiple bots like Realbot and POD-Bot MM in the same game or make all players bleed alot if shot so you can track them down <span class="style9">:)</span></p>

<p class="style2">POD-Bot MM Waypoints</p>
<p>The waypoints for POD-Bot MM can be found almost anywhere so if you have a map with no waypoints then why not try a google search for them. POD-Bot MM can use any of the old POD-Bot v1.0 to v2.5
waypoints as well as the clones of POD-Bot (IvpBot, YaPBBot, E[Pod]Bot)</p>

<p><span class="style13">Note:</span> The only thing that you may find wrong with non-PODBot MM waypoints is that the bots will camp funny, this is because a correction was made to the POD-Bot MM the
were using camp vectors instead of angles. A simple waypoint edit if camp&#39;s can be done to fix this, Please check here for how.</p>
