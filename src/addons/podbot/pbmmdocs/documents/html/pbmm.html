<p><span class="style2">How To Play with Podbot:</span></p>

<p><span class="style2">Important:</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="style13">v2.6</span> A few new features have been added and some commands have been depreciated.</p>

<p class="style2">Waypoint Folder:</p>
<p>PodBot MM uses the default folder for Waypoints which was used since v2.0 which is &quot; <span class="style8">\PODBot\WPTDefault\</span>&quot;.</p>

<p class="style2">The PODBot User Menu (podbotmenu):</p>
<p>Pressing the &quot;=&quot; key in game (on listenserver only) a Menu with the following options should appear on your Screen:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../images/pbmenuall.jpg" alt="The PODBOT user menu" name="The PODBOT user menu" width="147" height="146" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">This is the PODBOT User Menu.</p>


<span class="style14">1. Quick Add Bot</span> - This does what it says. It quickly adds a Bot giving him a random name,   team, skill and model. Skill will be chosen randomly between your minbotskill/maxbotskill values specified in podbot.cfg.<br>
<span class="style14">2. Add specific Bot</span> - Allows you specify all things (except name) for adding a single Bot.<br>
  
<p align="center"><img src="../images/pbmenuaddskill.jpg" alt="Choose a skill from menu" name="Choose a skill from menu" width="158" height="170" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">This lets You choose a skill for specyfic Bot.</p><br>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/pbmenuaddpers.jpg" alt="Choose a personality from menu" name="Choose a personality from menu" width="197" height="132" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">This lets You choose a personality for specyfic Bot.</p><br>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/pbmenuaddteam.jpg" alt="Choose a team from menu" name="Choose a team from menu" width="163" height="119" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">This lets You choose a team for specyfic Bot.</p><br>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/pbmenuaddtmodel.jpg" alt="Choose a model from menu (T team)" name="Choose a model from menu (T team)" width="226" height="119" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">This lets You choose a model for specyfic Bot (T team).</p><br>

<p align="center" class="style11">This lets You choose a model for specyfic Bot (CT team).</p><br>
  
<span class="style14">3. Kill all Bots</span> - Kills all Bots in all Teams. You can use this to end Rounds faster if there aren't any humans alive and you don't like watching Bots playing better than you <span class="style14">:)</span><br>
<span class="style14">4. Newround</span> - Same as above, but kills every Client including human players.<br>
<span class="style14">5. Fill Server</span> - Fills all free Server Entries with Bots (until reaching max_bots value). After selecting 
this option you can specify the team or to auto-assign them. If you especially select a team for the Bots the 
Server Variables &quot; <span class="style8">mp_autoteambalance</span>&quot; and 
&quot; <span class="style8">mp_limitteams</span>&quot; will be set to 0 (thus not caring about balancing teams 
anymore) and all Bots will only join 1 Team. You can use for example this to play alone or with your friends against 
all Bots.<br>
<span class="style14">6. Kick Bot</span> - Selecting this option opens the new selection, where You can choose which one
bot You wish to kick. There are 4 pages (for 32 players). If some slot is free or is used by some human-player or other bot
then You will see the info for that slot "Not a PodbotMM".<br>

<span class="style14">7. Kick all Bots</span> - Kicks off all Bots from the Server.<br>
<span class="style14">8. Weapon Mode</span> - Opens another Sub-Menu where you can select the Weapons Bots will buy (and use in combat). Selecting Knife Mode will also turn on Jason-Mode.
 Selecting Standard Weapons will turn it off again.<br>

<p class="style2">FunModes:</p>
<p align="left">This was one of the features removed when PODBot was ported to metamod.</p>

<p class="style2">Ordering Bots through Radio Commands:</p>
<p>You can use some of the Radio Commands to get more support from your Bots<br>
  Note: When you issue a <span class="style15">'Follow me</span>' Command Bots won't follow you in 3 cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Bots have their own will and they issue a &quot;<span class="style15">Negative</span>&quot; if they don't want to follow you.</li>
  <li>They don't see you.</li>
  <li>They see an enemy and engage the target.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <span class="style12">Terrorist</span> Bot carrying the C4 or picking it up, will also issue a &quot;<span class="style15">Follow Me</span>&quot; 
sometimes to have some assistance with him. (<span class= "style8">Note:</span> that they have problems following on ladders at the moment because the movement is unwaypointed.) 
They also do some other Radio Commands like &quot;<span class="style15">Need Backup</span>&quot;, &quot;
<span class="style15">Enemy down</span>&quot;, &quot; <span class="style15">Enemy spotted</span>&quot;, &quot; 
<span class="style15">I'm in Position</span>&quot; (to tell you he's camping) but not very often, otherwise it would 
surely get on your nerves...</p>

<p class="style2">Summary of Bot Reactions to Radio Commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="style15">Follow me</span> - Forces Bots in the near to follow you. You can specify the maximum number 
  of bots following in the podbot.cfg (defaults to 3).</li>
  <li><span class="style15">Hold this Position</span> - Makes a Bot who's following you, stay a while at that position 
  and look around for enemies.</li>
  <li><span class="style15">Taking Fire, need assistance</span> - Makes all living Bots (not engaged in a Fight) run to 
  your position to assist you.</li>
  <li><span class="style15">Need Backup</span> - Basically the same as above, but limited to distance and also 
  the Bots use it sometimes to get some support.</li>
  <li><span class="style15">Storm the Front!</span> - Mighty command! Forces all Bots in the near to rush in the 
  direction you're pointing to when using that command. Basically their level of aggression is increased so 
  a pathetic frightened Bot could also turn around and flee.</li>
  <li><span class="style15">Get in position...</span> - Bots in the near will try to take a covered position and stay 
  there until they either encounter an enemy, you order them to leave, or they waited too long.</li>
  <li><span class="style15">Go,go,go</span> - If a Bot follows you, this commands stops him from following. If there 
  are other Bots in the near, they will stop camping and going to roam the map again (normally used in combination with
   &quot;<span class="style15">Get in position...</span>&quot;)</li>
  <li><span class="style15">Team, Fall Back!</span> - Opposite of &quot;<span class="style15">Storm the Front</span>&quot;. 
  Increases Fear and decreases aggression of Bots in the near so that they are more likely to fall back and stay covered 
  for a short period.</li>
</ul><br>

<p class="style2">Bot Skill differences:</p>
<p>There is a file called botskill.cfg were you can tweak most skill parameters of the bots by editing the file 'botskill.cfg' 
with any text-editor.<br>
  Also take a look into 'podbot.cfg' to adjust some more things to your liking...settings for the Bots if you find them too 
  easy/too hard,<br>
  First, Bots with low skills will pause/camp longer and more often, Bots with low skills have a bigger surprise time and they
  shoot slower and are lucky if they hit something..<br>
  Then there are minor behaviour differences. For example Bots with a skill above 80 use the Knife more often if you're 
  near them.<br>
  If you want to get headshots all the time and attack really fast - add some Bots with a skill of 100.</p><br>

<p class="style2">Bot Personalities:</p>
<p>There are 3 different Personalities in POD now, if you have '<span class="style14">detailnames</span>' turned on they are 
shown through the Prefixes like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li><span class="style13">[P*D]</span> = <span class="style13">Agressive Bot</span></li>
  <li><span class="style13">[POD]</span> = <span class="style13">Normal Bot</span></li>
  <li><span class="style13">[P0D]</span> = <span class="style13">Defensive Bot</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Right now these personalities affect only bot's buying system. In the future we want to extend a lot of stuff around 
Personalities, but You can specify which one type of personlity has to be added to the game by addbot command 
(or fillserver or from podbotmenu) .</p><br>

<p class="style2">BotChats:</p>
<p>The botchats are files which store what the bot can say during the game and when it's spectating.<br>
  They are located in the podbot\botchats Folder where you installed the Bot.<br>
  The translated versions (except the German and English ones) don't use the new Text replacements and the dynamic keyword 
  chat is still in English language.<br>
  Rename and copy one of these to &quot;botchat.txt&quot; in the main podbot folder to have your localized Bot Talk.</p>
<p>These translated versions of the Botchat are available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>BotChat.txt (default english version)</li>
  <li>BotChatBulgarian.txt</li>
  <li>BotChatCroatian.txt</li>
  <li>BotChatCzech.txt</li>
  <li>BotChatDanish.txt</li>
  <li>BotChatDutch.txt</li>
  <li>BotChatEnglish.txt</li>
  <li>BotChatFinnish.txt</li>
  <li>BotChatFrench.txt</li>
  <li>BotChatGerman.txt</li>

  <li>BotChatNorwegian.txt</li>
  <li>BotChatPolish.txt</li>
  <li>BotChatPortuguese.txt</li>
  <li>BotChatRomanian.txt</li>
  <li>BotChatRussian.txt</li>
  <li>BotChatSerbian.txt</li>
  <li>BotChatSpanish.txt</li>
  <li>BotChatSwedish.txt</li>
  <li>BotChatTagalog.txt</li>
  <li>BotChatTurkish.txt</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="style2">Auto add/kick bot function</span></p>

<p>What do the people want? They want to keep as constant the number of bots+players at the server, but sometimes 
this was not working correct in old PB2.5 (client connection failed - bot didn't rejoin back) - sometimes this made 
a server empty. Another people want the same but with the possibility of some manual control of bots on the server 
(some manual kick, some manual add, some removebots and some fillserver - these function have to be still availiable). 
How to solve this?<br>
Now in code is a variable invisible for user-admin. It's name is g_iPeoBotsKept - this variable defines <B>how many 
bots+players shuld be still on the server</B>. This name is only here for explaining how this is working now.<br>
The meaning of max_bots and min_bots - these are limits only but with possibility change them from console by:<br>
pb max_bots {new_value}<br>
pb min_bots {new_value}<br>
The max_bots variable defines <B>how many bots+players</B> will be on the server when You will use fillserver command 
(of course - if there are on the server some sufficient slots for all of them) or addbot commands. The min_bots 
variable defines <B>the minimum number of bots</B> must stay on the server when:<br>
a) You will call removebots command<br>
b) some of them will be kicked because of joining some people.<br>
You can define max_bots as 12 and min_bots as 2 and put 8 addbot commands in podbot.cfg - then g_iPeoBotsKept 
is calculated (automaticaly) as 8 - for example - because it's incremented every single addbot command. If You use 
fillserver - this variable will reach 12 (in our example) - in the case of calling fillserver g_iPeoBotsKept is 
overwitten by max_bots variabale.<br>

NOTE:<br>
On listenserver except addbots commands also the host (the player-LS owner) is calculated (added) to g_iPeoBotsKept.
So in the case if he has - for example - 8 addbots commands in his podbot.cfg - g_iPeoBotsKept variable will be 9
(at start host and 8 bots on the server).<br>

At the first map (server started) the first bots added to the server are from podbot.cfg - these
added by addbot commands or fillserver. If there are 4 addbot commands - first will enter the game these 4 specyfied
by these commands and after - if there is also a fillserver command - automaticaly will be added some other bots 
(according to other parameters of the fillserver command, max_bots and other parameters).<br>
So - You started the game with 8 bots. Then one player is connected and entered the game, then one bot is automaticaly
kicked. Player is disconnected - bot is automaticaly added. This is checked every frame - if still g_iPeoBotsKept is 
the same like number of bots+players.<br>
If You decide manualy add some bot (from podbotmenu or by pb addbot command from console) - bot will be added according 
to this what You specify (if You type pb addbot 100 2 2 3 "Rocky" - just exactly this bot will be added - not some bot 
automaticaly). In this case g_iPeoBotsKept variable will be automaticaly incremented by 1. If You decide to kick manually 
some bot - bot will be kicked. If from podbotmenu - You can select iwhicj one should be kicked from menu (4 pages),
if from console:<br>
pb remove #bot_id<BR>
or
pb remove bot_name<BR>
bot_id means the same like id for standard kick command.<br>
In this case g_iPeoBotsKept variable will be automaticaly decremented by 1. Of course all here is valid only if You are 
in range min/max bots You specyfied before.
If You decide to use fillserver and You have actualy 10 bots+players on the server - bots will be added automaticaly 
until reaching bots + players = max_bots (in our example 12). In this case g_iPeoBotsKept will be overwritten by 
max_bots variable (12).<br>
The same for removebots - If You decide to use this command, bots will be removed from the server until reaching 
bots + players = min_bots (in our example 2). In this case g_iPeoBotsKept variable will be overwritten by min_bots 
variable (2). If You will write in console :<br>
pb max_bots 6<br>
it will decrase (if is grater) the g_iPeoBotsKept variable to 6 and some bots will be probably kicked.<br> 
If You will write in console:<br>
pb min_bots 7<br>
it will incrase (if is lower) the g_iPeoBotsKept variable to 7 and some bots will be probably added. This "probably" 
above is depanding of actual situation on the server - if the number of human-players lets kick or add some bots in these 
both situations.<br>
Connecting to the game more human-players than is actually calculated g_iPeoBotsKept will not affect this variable. 
If You have this variable as 10 and there is 12 human-players - of course You can't kick more bots.<br>
All here can work automaticaly and there is still some control and possiblity of manual bots management.<br>
If You want some delay for bots re-join at new map start then write in console this line:<br>
pb mapstartbotdelay 10<br>
and bot will be joined on the new map after 10s since map start. The same command (but without "pb") You can write in
podbot.cfg.<br><br>

If because of some reason You don't like this function (auto add/kick bots) You can simply disable it by writting in console:<br>
pb max_bots 0<br>
(or without "pb" in podbot.cfg file).<br>
In this case the value of g_iPeoBotsKept is then following the current number of bots + players, but no one bot will
be automatically added or kicked. Enabling back the function (by typing some different than 0 number for
max_bots) should change nothing on the server (no one bot should be added or kicked after enabling this function) except
the situation You specify some max_bots less than current number of bots+players on the server (in this case some of them
will be kicked until reaching bots+players = max_bots).</p><br>

<p><span class="style2">Known Limitations/Bugs/Problems still present:</span></p>
<p>Bots sometimes fall from high places<br>
 Sometimes stuck in other Bots (but should unstuck after less than 5 secs)<br>
 Sometimes stuck in corners (see above)<br>
 Counter Bots sometimes fail to detect the bomb (but happens to humans also, so what?)<br>
 Bots lack advanced teamplay (very basic team-play and affection is present)<br>
 Bots are too easy to snipe, see above<br>
 Bots aren't affected by darkness<br>
 Bots don't drive vehicles, hopefully in the 'Source' engine they will :) <br>
 Due to HL Engine Limitations Bots can see through func_illusionaries (e.g. curtains in cs_747, doors in cs_backalley)<br>
 Bots don't cheat <span class="style14">:)</span></p>

<p><span class="style2">Planned for future Releases:</span></p>
<p>Refining Combat Behaviours and Weapon Choices<br>
 Customisation of Personalities incorporated into a Clan-System<br>
 Advanced Team Behaviour<br>
 Vehicle support <span class="style14">:)</span><br>
 Elimination of most remaining Bugs and Limitations of the above list</p>
