<div align="center"><span class="style1">Availiable commands for podbot</span></div><br>

<div><span class="style2">Commands in podbot.cfg file</span></div>

<p><span class="style14">minbotskill</span> (value) - Sets the minimum Skill if Bots are created without
specifying the Skill. Correct values are 1-100. Default is 1. <p>

<p><span class="style14">maxbotskill</span> (value) - Sets the maximum Skill if Bots are created without
specifying the Skill. Must be bigger than minbotskill of course ! Correct values are minbotskill-100. 
Default is 100.<p>

<p><span class="style14">min_bots</span> (value) - configure the minimum number of bots that will run
on the server. Default is 0.</p>

<p><span class="style14">max_bots</span> (value) - configure the maximum number of bots that will run
on the server. Default is 0.</p>

<p>If You don't specify min/max_bots (You will comment them out in Your podbot.cfg) then the function 
auto/add kick bot (described a bit below) will not work. If You specify them - then they will support 
a minimum and maximum number of bots running on the server.  Bots will be added to the server until 
the total number of players (bots and humans) reaches the max_bots value.
Each time a new player joins the server, a bot will be kicked from the server unless there are only 
min_bots number of bots currently on the server.  After players disconnect from the server, bots will
be automatically added back to the server until the total number of players reaches max_bots again.
You should make max_bots be AT LEAST one less than the maxplayers value (otherwise no one will be able
to join your server). Some more explanation to this function You can find here: 
<span class="style13">bla_bla_link</span></p>

<p><span class="style14">botchat</span> (on|off) - Turns on/off Botchatting. Bots chat if they killed
someone, if the Bomb was planted or if they are dead and bored. Default is on.<p>

<p><span class="style14">jasonmode</span> (on|off) - Turns on/off Jason Mode ! Meaning Bots don't buy
weapons and only use the knife for combat ! Greets to Auxois ! Use this for much fun with e.a. cs_estate

<p><span class="style14">wptfolder</span> (folder) - Sets the default Folder for loading/saving Waypoint
Files. This folder HAS to be inside the POD-Bot Directory ! Don't put it into quotation marks and

<p><span class="style14">detailnames</span> (on|off) - Turns on/off the Skilldisplay behind names and the
personality ( [POD], [P*D], [P0D] ) before the name. Default is on.</p>

<p><span class="style14">inhumanturns</span> (on|off) - If you think that a Skill 100 Bot is too weak for

this overrides the turn amounts in botskill.cfg . Default is off</p>
 
<p><span class="style14">botsfollowuser</span> (number) - Sets the maximum number of Bots in the team to

<span class="style14">timer_grenade</span> (value) - Default is 0.5 (in seconds).<br>

These Settings above specify the rate (in seconds) of updating some of the Bot Checks like:
some sound, some possibility of pickup any item or usage grenade by bots.
If you've got a slow computer you could try changing these to higher values to get some 
performance back.<br>
<span class="style11">NOTE: </span><br>
This seriously affects the Bots Perception. If you have a fast computer you might try 
lowering them to get better even better playing results. </p>

<p><span class="style14">welcome_msgs</span> (on|off) - Lets You to disable some welcome messages, 
if You would like for example the people don't know there are some bots on the server. 
Default is on.</p>

<p><span class="style14">danger_factor</span> (value) - The setting here specifies the danger 
factor with which the bots will weighten any waypoint where they have been killed in the past,
in order to avoid it later. The higher the value, the more the bot will care about these 
waypoints and pick other routes instead. Progression is logarithmic. Warning: higher values 
require more CPU. Default is 2000.</p>

<p><span class="style14">addbot</span> [skill [personality [team [model [name]]]]]</p>
<p>Adds a Bot with parameters - skill You can write from 1 to 100; if You will write 101 it will mean 
random skill from minbotskili to maxbotskill specified above.<br>
Personality - 1 to 3 or 5 and these value mean:<br>
<ul>
  <li>1 - Normal [POD]</li>
  <li>2 - Aggresive [P*D]</li>
  <li>3 - Defensive [P0D]</li>
  <li>5 - Random personality from these 3 above</li>
</ul><br>
Team 1 is for Terrorists, 2 for Counter Terrorists and 5 to use auto-assign.<br>
Model (class) is 1-4 or 5 (5 means random from 1 to 4).<br>
Name is of course the name for this Bot.<br>
If You want to use space in the name of Your bot You have to use quotes 
(for example: addbot 100 2 1 4 "James Bond").<br>
You may not specify some argument without these before (for example - You may not specify bot's name 
without its skill nor personality nor team nor model - like this: <br>
addbot Roger<br>
this is an invalid call of the function addbot and then some bot with all random parameters 
(including also the name) will be added to the game.<br>
You don't need of course specify all parameters - but if You need to specify some of them exactly - all other 
You have to specify as random. In our example to add some bot with the name Roger You have to write the line:<br>
<br>
addbot 101 5 5 5 Roger<br>
<br>
and this call of addbot function is correctly.<br>
If You want to add some bot to the game with skill 100 to T team, the line should be like this:<br>
addbot 100 5 1<br>

In this case the parameters AFTER the latest one You need to specify - aren't important (You don't need write
anything more). The model will be selected automatically and the name will be choosen from botnames.txt file.<br>
<p>Some other examples:</p>
addbot -->skill gets based on mix\max, all else random<br>
addbot 50 -->skill is 50 all else random<br>
addbot joeblogs --> skill is based on min/max, name is joeblogs, all else random<br>
addbot 100 1 2 1 "Mr Kabby" -->all have been set<br><br>

<p><span class="style14">fillserver</span> [skill [personality [team [model]]]]</p>
Meaning of the parameters is like for addbot command. This command let You fill the server by bots
until reaching by podbots+human_players(or other bots):<br>
a) the max_bots value if it is specyfied (different than 0)<br>
b) max_players if max_bots is not specyfied (or is equal to 0)<br><br>

If You want fill Your server by bots with random skill (between minbotskill and maxbotskill), but as 
"aggresssive" (and You don't care about their models or team), write this line:<br>
fillserver 101 2<br>
If You want for example fill the server by bots with skill 100, random personality , random team and 
random model - write this line:<br>
fillserver 100 <br>
If You wish to fill the server by bots, but all bots to one team only - then write this:<br>
a)example for T team and skill 90, all else random:<br>
fillserver 90 5 1<br>
b)example for CT team and skill and personalities randomly, model 3:<br>
fillserver 101 5 2 3<br>
The rules are the same for parameters like for addbot command (except 'name' parameter - 
for fillserver this parameter doesn't exist).<br>
<P class="style11">NOTE:</p>
If You want fill server by bots to only one team don't forget set-up game variables 
"mp_autoteambalance" and "mp_limitteams" to 0.<br><br>

<div><span class="style2">Podbot control console commands</span></div>

<p>You can change all parameters described above from console - if You wish to do this. 
Any command You want to write in console for this bot You have to start with prefix "pb" 
without quotes. For example: <br>
pb minbotskill 60<br>
pb jasonmode on<br></p>
<p>Except these commands described above there are also some other available commands You can 
write in console.<br></p>

<p><span class="style14">pb experience</span> - this command force bot dll to save 
the experience file (pxp) exactly at the moment of calling it (after typing in console). 
Normally these pxp files (with experience of bots - like sombody died near some waypoint 
number) are saved at the end of the map (before starting the new one).</p>

<p><span class="style14">pb help</span> - this command lists all available bot console commands.
In the future we want to write more precisly help for every command separately.</p>

<p><span class="style14">pb killbots</span> - this command kill all pod bots in the game.
Useful for testing if bots got stuck somewhere becasue of bad waypointing and You want simply 
finish the round.</p>

<p><span class="style14">pb remove</span> (#bot_id | bot_name) - this command lets kick 
the selected bot from the game. bot_id parameter is this what You can see when You write 
status in console (the same like for standard kick command). bot_name - it's second method
to specify which one bot has to be kicked (it's like kick by the name).</p>
<P class="style11">NOTE:</p>
<p>If Your bot has a space in its name (for example - James Bond) You need to use quotes 
to successfully usage of the remove command. Example:<br>
pb remove "[P*D]James Bond (100)"<br>
Look at this example with attention - if detailnames is on - You have to write also this personality
prefix and skill sufix - all must be in quotes - because all of this it's the bot's name in this
example.</p>

<p><span class="style14">pb removebots</span> - this command kick bots from Your server until 
reaching min_bots. If min_bots is 0 then all bots will be kicked out by this command.</p>

<p><span class="style14">pb weaponmode</span> (value) - correct value are 1 to 7. This command lets
You select the weapon will be used by bots only (they will not buy another type).
<ul>
  <li>1 - Knife only (JasonMode!)</li>
  <li>2 - Pistols</li>
  <li>3 - Shotguns</li>
  <li>4 - Machine Guns</li>
  <li>5 - Rifles</li>
  <li>6 - Sniper Weapons</li>
  <li>7 - All Weapons (Standard)</li>
</ul></p>

<p><span class="style14">pb version</span> - this command returns the version number (as a string) 
of the POD's build</p>

<div><span class="style2">Waypoint console commands</span></div>

<p>These commands below are valid only on listenserver.</p>

<p><span class="style14">waypoint teleport</span> (value) - Teleports You to the waypoint number You write here.</p>

<p><span class="style14">waypoint stats</span> - Shows the number of different waypoints you did 
already set.</p>

<p><span class="style14">pb debuggoal</span> (value) - this command force bots to go to 
the waypoint number specyfied here as a goal (target). Default is -1 (-1 means no extra goal waypoint specyfied
and bots aren't forced to go to some waypoint). More info You can find in Waypointing section of this doc.
