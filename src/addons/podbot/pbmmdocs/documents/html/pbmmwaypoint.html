<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="style13">To PODBot v2.5 Waypoint Makers please read:</p>

<p>If you are familiar with making waypoints for PODBot 2.5, you won't need to read the following two sections that are meant as an introduction for people who are new to waypointing.</p>
<p>However, make sure you have a close look at the <span class="style13">new console commands</span> and the <span class="style13">new waypoint menu</span> - there have been loads of changes there!
Most of the waypointing is done via the menu now, and almost all console commands have disappeared entirely. You will not be able to use your old configs/binds with this editor. But you will love all
the new features and possibilities!<br></p>

<p><span class="style13">Note On Compatibility:</span> PODBot MM can still interpret all PODBot waypoint files from earlier versions up to 2.5, but the code for camp waypoints has been corrected. If
you use an older waypoint set with this dll, your bots will look at strange directions when camping. In order to have them look exactly where you want them to look, you must replace these old camp
waypoints by new ones.</p>

<p><span class="style13">New Button Code:</span> On maps with buttons, you may have to tweak the (formerly useless) button flags again. You can now avoid bots ringing doorbells or doing other silly
stuff with unimportant buttons, but you can have them go through button-triggered doors without problems now!</p>

<span class="style2">Waypoints, what are they ?</span> 

<p>Unlike humans, bots cannot see a map and analyze what they see. If you see a building with a door, you can walk straight to the door, open it and enter the building.<br>
 Bots cannot do this without help! They can see and fight enemies or react if they are being attacked. These ways of behaviour work without any external help. But in order to find their way around
the map and to safely navigate through all ways and passages, they do need some help. They need something that tells them where they can go and where they can't. They need something that shows them
where a ladder is located or where the mission goal (escape zone/hostages/bomb spot) is. This is done by means of waypoints. You can imagine waypoints a bit like those flags on a ski run. Each
waypoint marks a point where bots can go. If two of them are connected with each other, a bot can go from one point to the other and back. So what you do when you waypoint a map is basically place a
whole net of points in the map and connect them in a way that bots can proceed from one point to the other. All points must be placed in areas that are accessible for players, and if you want your
bots to navigate smoothly and safely, you must also keep an eye on the connections. If connections go through walls or over a deep ravine, your bots will bump into walls or fall to their death.<br>
There are several waypoint types that can be used to indicate map goals, rescue zones, nice camp spots, ladders etc. There are different types of connections too, one-way or two-way connections and
jump connections that will make a bot jump from point A to B instead of walking or running there. We will come back to this later.</p>
<p>Besides, you don't have to worry about every little detail. The editor that comes with this bot version will do lots of the work for you, and besides, it's graphical and easy to use (no
programming/coding skills or anything required). You may very well discover that making waypoints can be fun, especially when you see bots roam through the entire map without problems - and <i>
you</i> made it possible! <span class="style9">:)</span>.</p>

<span class="style2">What do waypoints look like in the game ?</span> 

<p>When you are playing a normal game on a waypointed map, the waypoints will of course be invisible so that they don't distract or annoy you in any way.<br>
When waypointing is activated (see: How can I access the waypoint editor?, Below for instructions on how to do that), you will see waypoints as vertical bars about as high as a standing player. The
colour of normal waypoints is green, but you may also see waypoints in white, purple, red, blue and cyan. These colours indicate special waypoints, some of which have already been mentioned in the
last paragraph. If you see waypoints that are much smaller than the other ones, they are crouch waypoints. They will force bots to crouch when approaching them. Such waypoints are needed to lead bots
through vents or any other low and narrow passages.<br>
Connections between waypoints are marked as horizontal lines leading from the centre of one waypoint to the other. They, too, exist in different colours. You may see yellow, white, red and teal
lines. Don't worry if all these different colours sound confusing right now - it's actually very easy, but of course it helps a lot if you see some waypoints on the screen.<br>
Now you know what waypoints and connections are, what they are for and what they look like, you may want to enter the editing mode and see for yourself.</p>

<span class="style2">How can I access the waypoint editor ?</span> 

<p>The waypoint editor is not a separate program, it is included in the bot dll (or .so, if you are using linux).To open it, create a <span class="style13">LAN\Listen Server</span> game, select the
map you want to waypoint and start the game as usual. As soon as you are in the map, you can activate the editing mode from the console or if you have bound a key for it, simply by pressing that
key.</p>

<p class="style2">Waypoints:</p>
<p class="style2">Adding waypoints</p>

<p>Adding a waypoint is really easy. Just walk to the position where you want a waypoint to be inserted, bring up your waypoint menu:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/men1main.jpg" alt="The main WP menu" name="The main WP menu" width="140" height="340" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">This is the main Waypoint Menu.</p>

<p>To add a waypoint, simply select &quot;<span class="style14">1. Add</span>.&quot; A new menu will appear, the &quot;<span class="style14">Add Waypoint</span>&quot; menu. All waypoint types described below can be
added by using this menu.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/men2addw.jpg" alt="The add WP menu" name="The add WP menu" width="140" height="340" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">The &quot;Add Waypoint&quot; menu.</p>

<p>Once you have selected a waypoint type from the &quot;<span class="style14">Add Waypoint</span>&quot; menu, you will hear a sound, and the selected waypoint will appear in the map, at the exact position
where you stood when you pressed the key.<br>
 <span class="style13">NOTE:</span> If you are standing while selecting a waypoint, a standing waypoint will be inserted. All bots will run or walk towards this waypoint normally.<br>
 If you want bots to crouch when approaching a particular position, crouch down when inserting the waypoint. You will notice that the waypoint you just added is only about half as high as normally.
As you inserted it when you were crouched down, it automatically carries a &quot;<span class="style21">Crouch</span>&quot; flag (see: Types Of Waypoints). Bots will now crouch automatically when trying to
reach this waypoint.</p>
<p>Now that you know the basic method used to add a waypoint, let's have a closer look at the waypoint types that exist.</p>

<p class="style2">Types of Waypoints:</p>

<p><span class="style18">Normal</span> waypoints</p>
<p><span class="style18">Normal</span> waypoints are the points you need in order to make bots walk through the map. They are used for navigation only and will not trigger any particular behaviour.
You can add a <span class="style18">Normal</span> waypoint by selecting &quot;<span class="style14">1. Normal</span>&quot; from the &quot;<span class="style14">Add waypoint</span>&quot; menu. <span class="style18">The
colour of Normal waypoints is green</span>, as you can see in the picture below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/wp01norm.jpg" alt="Normal waypoints" name="Normal waypoints" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>

<p align="center" class="style11">A Crouched Normal waypoint (left) and a Normal waypoint (right)</p>

<span class="style12">Terrorist Important</span> waypoints 
<p>This type of waypoints can be navigated just as a <span class="style18">Normal</span> waypoint by all bots, but it has one additional function. It marks strategically important points for a
Terrorist team. Adding a <span class="style12">Terrorist Important</span> point in a room will tell Terrorist bots to go to the room and check it frequently. You can add this type of waypoint by
selecting &quot;<span class="style14">2. T Important</span>&quot; from the &quot;<span class="style14">Add Waypoint</span>&quot; menu. <span class="style12">The colour of Terrorist Important waypoints is red</span>, as
you can see in the picture below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/wp02terr.jpg" alt="T-important waypoints" name="T-important waypoints" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">A Crouched Terrorist Important waypoint (left) and a Normal Terrorist Important (right)</p>

<span class="style13">IMPORTANT:</span> The use of <span class="style12">Terrorist Important</span> points depends on the map type!<br>
Wherever the Terrorist team is the &quot;defending&quot; team (i.e. on As_ Cs_ type maps), <span class="style12">Terrorist Important</span> points should be placed at key positions around the hostage area or
VIP escape zone. For example, if the hostages are inside a building, <span class="style12">Terrorist Important</span> points should be added behind each entrance to the building. Doing so will make
the Terrorists check all entrances frequently and guard them. Do not place <span class="style12">Terrorist Important</span> points far away on the other side of the map. After all, you don't want the
Terrorists to abandon the hostages and rush planlessly through the map, now, do you? With the VIP escape zone, the same strategy applies, Make Terrorists guard the key routes to the escape zone by
using <span class="style12">Terrorist Important</span> waypoints.<br>
You <span class="style13">DON'T</span> need to place <span class="style12">Terrorist Important</span> points directly at the hostages. Terrorists will check on hostages anyway.<br>
On maps where the Terrorist team is &quot;offensive&quot; (i.e. De_ and Es_ type maps), <span class="style12">Terrorist Important</span> waypoints should not be overused. The &quot;offensive&quot; team will try to reach
the map goal waypoint anyway. The only useful function you can use important waypoints for is to make particular routes more attractive for the bots. For example, if there is a longer and more
complicated, but safer and more surprising route to the map goal, bots may tend to underuse it a little. In such cases, placing one or two <span class="style12">Terrorist Important</span> waypoints
along this route can help. <span class="style17">Counter-Terrorists Important</span> waypoints 

<p>The function of this waypoint type is exactly the same as the <span class="style12">Terrorist Important</span> waypoint described above. The only difference is that a <span class="style17">
Counter-Terrorists Important</span> waypoint obviously marks strategically important places for the <span class="style17">Counter-Terrorist (CT)</span> team. You can add this type of waypoint by
selecting &quot;<span class="style14">3. CT Importanat</span>&quot; from the &quot;<span class="style14">Add Waypoint</span>&quot; menu. <span class="style17">The colour of Counter-Terrorist Important waypoints is
blue</span>, as you can see in the picture below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/wp03cntr.jpg" alt="CT-important waypoints" name="CT-important waypoints" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">Two Counter-Terrorists important waypoints, normal (right) and crouched (left)</p>

<span class="style13">IMPORTANT:</span> As with the other team specific waypoints, <span class="style17">Counter-Terrorist Important</span> waypoints should also be placed according to the map type.
On maps where the Counter-Terrorist team is forced to move out and reach a certain goal - either hostages to rescue or a VIP escape zone to reach safely. <span class="style17">Counter-Terrorist
Important</span> points can be useful to make a particular route more attractive. You DON'T need to place <span class="style17">Counter-Terrorist Important</span> points near a map goal (hostages on
CS_ maps, VIP escape zone(s) on As_ maps), Counter-Terrorist bots will go there anyway. It's the most important point for them, and adding several other important waypoints right next to it doesn't
yield any benefit.<br>
On maps where the Counter-Terrosist team is in a defensive role (i.e. on De_ maps and Es_ maps), place <span class="style17">Counter-Terrorist Important</span> points at key positions around the
bomb/escape zone(s) in order to make Counter-Terrorist bots defend all possible routes to the Terrorists map goal. <span class="style20">Ladder</span> waypoints 

<p><span class="style20">Ladder</span> waypoints are only used for waypointing ladders, as you possibly guessed. To enable your bots to use a ladder, simply walk up to the ladder until you get
&quot;stuck&quot; on it (you will see your crosshair grow wider once you are on the ladder). Now place one <span class="style20">Ladder</span> waypoint at the bottom of the ladder. Then climb up the ladder
until you are almost completely over the edge. Place a second waypoint here and make sure that the two ladder waypoints are connected, (This should have happened automatically if the <span class= 
"style20">Ladder</span> waypoints aren't too far away from each other, if not you can creat a connection manually), That's all! You can add this type of waypoint by selecting &quot;<span class=
"style14">4. Ladder</span> &quot; from the &quot;<span class="style14">Add Waypoint</span>&quot; menu. <span class="style20">The colour of Ladder waypoints is pink</span>, as you can see in the picture below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/wp04lddr.jpg" alt="Ladder waypoints" name="Ladder waypoints" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">A waypointed Ladder, one Ladder waypoint at the bottom, the other near the top</p>
Some general hints and notes concerning ladder waypoints: 
<ul>
<li>Waypoint ladders AFTER you waypointed the areas above and below them! If you waypoint ladders first, all waypoints in reach of a ladder waypoint will be connected with it and have their radii
reduced to zero automatically!</li>
<li>It doesn't matter whether you place the top or the bottom <span class="style20">Ladder</span> waypoint first.</li>
<li>If the ladder is very long, you can place additional <span class="style20">Ladder</span> waypoints between the bottom and the top end.</li>
<li>The bottom waypoint will automatically get connected with the nearest waypoint, independent of current AutoPath Max Distance settings.</li>
<li>The top waypoint will usually get a connection towards it automatically, but you will have to add a connection leading away from it manually.</li>
<li><span class="style20">Ladder</span> waypoints will always have a radius of zero, and this shouldn't be changed!</li>
</ul>

<span class="style16">Rescue</span> waypoints 
<p><span class="style16">Rescue</span> waypoints are only needed on Cs_ type maps (hostage rescue scenarios). They mark the zone where the Counter-Terrosist team must bring the hostages, the rescue
zone. Place one of these waypoint inside each rescue zone there is. If there is only one, you only need one <span class="style16">Rescue</span> waypoint. Placing more points in one rescue zone is
unnecessary bulk and will rather cause problems than improve anything.<br>
 A Counter-Terrosist bot that has succeeded in &quot;activating&quot; the hostages will determine the position of the nearest rescue point and lead the hostages there. As soon the bot has reached the rescue
point, it will consider the hostages as rescued and turn back to return to combat. Badly placed rescue points may lead to bots turning around before the hostages have reached the rescue zone. As a
consequence, the hostages will be left standing a few inches away from the rescue zone while the bot considers its mission as completed and turns back to fight, ignoring the deserted hostages. That's
why you are advised to place a rescue waypoint well inside a rescue zone, not at its edges!<br>
In the editor, rescue points will be displayed in bright white (see below). Their radius is set to zero by default and shouldn't be changed. All bots can use this waypoint type for <span class= 
"style18">Normal</span> navigation as well. You can add this type of waypoint by selecting &quot;<span class="style14">5. Rescue</span> &quot; from the &quot;<span class="style14">Add Waypoint</span>&quot; menu. <span
class="style16">The colour of Rescue waypoints is white</span>, as you can see in the picture below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/wp05resc.jpg" alt="A rescue point" name="Rescue point" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">A Rescue point. You can also make this point Crouched, of course.</p>

<span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoints 
<p>As the name suggests, <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoints are used to mark good sniper spots. They can be navigated by all bots. However, whether a bot may camp there or not is determined
by the flag you can add to the camp waypoint. You can make <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoints team specific or leave them &quot;open&quot; to any team. <span class="style19">The colour of Normal Camp
waypoints is cyan.</span> Terrorist specific camp waypoints have a reddish hue, Counter-Terrosist specific ones are a bit blueish, as you can see in the pictures below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/wp06cmpn.jpg" alt="Two normal camp waypoints" name="Normal camp points" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">Two Normal Camp waypoints, Standing (left) and Crouched (right).</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/wp07cmps.jpg" alt="Team-specific camp waypoints" name="Team-specific camp points" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>

<p align="center" class="style11">Team specific Camp waypoints:<br>
 Two Terrorists Specific points to the left and Two Counter-Terrorists Specific points to the right.</p>

Although there are two entries in the &quot;<span class="style14">Add Waypoint</span>&quot; menu (&quot;<span class="style14">Camp start</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class="style14">Camp end</span>&quot;), the <span class=
"style19">Camp</span> waypoint is in fact only one point. However, it carries two &quot;markers&quot; that tell a camping bot where to look while camping. When you are camping yourself, you will monitor a
certain area. If you wanted to define this area, you could describe it as an angle. This angle would be specified by two lines going out from your position: One that marks the left edge and another
one for the right edge. The monitored area would be between these two lines. The mentioned &quot;markers&quot; fulfill exactly this function. They are displayed as more or less horizontal beams going out from
the top of a <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoint. <span class="style15">The Camp start marker is yellow</span>, <span class="style21">the Camp end marker orange</span>, as you can see in the
picture below. 
<p align="center"><img src="../images/wp08cmpr.jpg" alt="A camp waypoint with camp start and camp end markers" name="A camp waypoint with camp start and camp end markers" width="480" height="360"
border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">A Crouched Normal Camp waypoint with Camp start (left, yellow) and Camp end (right, orange) markers.</p>
When a bot approaches the depicted <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoint, it will turn to face the direction of the <span class="style15">Camp start</span> marker (the yellow beam to the left)
first. Then it will slowly scan the area between this marker and the <span class="style21">Camp end</span> marker (orange beam to the right). An enemy moving outside the two markers may escape the
bot's attention, unless it hears the enemy coming. In the piture above, both markers are pointing to the same height. However, you can also specify different heights for each marker. This is very
useful for making bots monitor a ramp, a slope, a stairway or other uneven surfaces.<br>
So far, so good. But how to set a working camp waypoint? Follow these steps:<br>
<ul>
<li>Go to the exact position where you want bots to camp (of course, a dark corner or similar locations are best suited for camping, but whom do I tell this? <span class="style9">:o</span>)</li>
<li>If you want bots to stand while they are camping, remain standing upright. If you want them to crouch while camping (more precise aiming!), crouch yourself while adding the point</li>
<li>Point your crosshair at the exact direction and height where you want your bots to start looking.</li>
<li>Bring up the &quot;<span class="style14">Add Waypoint</span>&quot; menu and select &quot;<span class="style14">6. Camp start</span>&quot;. The <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoint itself will now be placed at
your current position, and you will see the two marker beams going out from it. The <span class="style15">Camp start</span> marker will already be pointed at the direction you specified, the <span
class="style21">Camp end</span> marker will still need some adjustment.</li>
<li>Now point your crosshair at the exact direction and height where you want your bots to end their monitoring.</li>
<li>Once again, open the &quot;<span class="style14">Add Waypoint</span>&quot; menu, but now select &quot;<span class="style14">7. Camp end</span>&quot;. You will see that the <span class="style21">Camp end</span>
marker will now be pointed at the direction you specified.</li>
</ul>

That's it! Unless you want to make your <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoint team specific or add another flag (see: Waypoint Flags section), you are done! In fact, it sounds much more
complicated than it actually is. 

<p>Some quick notes and hints about <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoints:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can alter <span class="style15">Camp start</span> and <span class="style21">Camp end</span> markers as often as you want. As soon as you are near an existing <span class="style19">Camp</span>
waypoint (i.e. as soon as its waypoint stats are shown in the upper left corner of your HUD), Bring up the &quot;<span class="style14">Add Waypoint</span>&quot; menu and selecting &quot;<span class="style14">6.
Camp start</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="style14">7. Camp end</span>&quot; will <span class="style13">NOT</span> add a new waypoint. Instead, it will readjust the <span class="style15">Camp start</span> and/or
<span class="style21">Camp end</span> marker(s) of the nearby <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoint to the new direction you specified.</li>
<li>Thus, if you want to place two <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoints closely together, make sure that the waypoint stats of the first one have disappeared from your HUD before you set the
second one. If the stats of the first waypoint are still visible, you will accidentally modify the <span class="style15">Camp start</span> and <span class="style21">Camp end</span> markers of that
waypoint instead of inserting a new point.</li>
<li>Don't place <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoints in strategically irrelevant areas, or you will see bots having a sitout in totally unimportant areas while their team mates are under heavy
attack.</li>
<li>Provide the &quot;defending&quot; team with some nice sniper spots near the map goal! In general, if you make team-specific <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoints, make more for the defending team
than for the attacking team.</li>
</ul>

<span class="style23">Map Goal</span> waypoints 
<p>This waypoint type obviously indicates the <span class="style23">Map Goal</span>.</p>
<p>On an As_ map, the <span class="style23">Map Goal</span> waypoint tells the bots where the VIP escape zone is. Make sure the escape zone symbol is visible on your HUD when you place a map goal
waypoint there. Otherwise the VIP may end up reaching the point and running away again just like you would do with <span class="style16">Rescue</span> waypoints.<br>
 On a Cs_ map, the <span class="style23">Map Goal</span> waypoint marks the position of the hostages. It is <span class="style13">NOT</span> necessary to place one <span class="style23">Map
Goal</span> waypoint per hostage. Unless the hostages are standing really far away from each other, one point per hostage group will perfectly do.<br>
 On a De_ map, the <span class="style23">Map Goal</span> waypoint marks the bomb spots. It must be placed somewhere inside the bomb zone, i.e. the bomb icon must be blinking on your HUD when you
place such a waypoint. In contrast to Cs_ maps, on De_ maps it makes sense to set various goal waypoints in one bomb zone. This will enable bots to choose from several spots to plant the bomb and
make them less predictable.<br>
 <span class="style13">NOTE:</span> Bots will always crouch down while planting the bomb. While it is perfectly possible to make the <span class="style23">Map Goal</span> waypoint crouched, but this
is not necessary if you want to make sure that your bots crouch to plant the bomb, they will do so anyway.<br>
 Finally, on Es_ maps, the <span class="style23">Map Goal</span> waypoint marks the escape zone for the Terrorists. You can follow the same rules as for As_ maps.<br>
 Now you may wonder how to determine the exact function of a the <span class="style23">Map Goal</span> waypoint. Don't worry, this is entirely map specific, you don't have to do anything about it.
All bots of both participating teams will automatically know what the the <span class="style23">Map Goal</span> is, they only need the point to guide them there. You can add this type of waypoint by
selecting &quot;<span class="style14">8. Goal</span>&quot; from the &quot;<span class="style14">Add Waypoint</span>&quot; menu. <span class="style23">The colour of Goal waypoints is purple</span>, as you can see in the
picture below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/wp09goal.jpg" alt="A map goal point, here at a bomb zone" name="Map goal waypoint" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">The purple waypoint on the marked spot is the Map Goal, in this case a bomb spot.</p>

<p><span class="style12">Jump</span> Connections</p>
<p><span class="style12">Jump</span> is not actually a waypoint but a connection between waypoints. (see: Waypoint Connections)</p>
<p>So now we've seen what type of waypoints the bots use, we can see how we can string these waypoints together to make a gaint web to cover the map with <span class="style9">:)</span></p>

<p class="style2">The Radius:</p>
<p class="style17">Radius</p>
<p>The <span class="style17">Radius</span> of a waypoint is indicated by means of horizontal blue beams that go out in all directions from the position of a waypoint. Viewed from above, the beams
form a pattern that is like the spokes of a bycyle wheel or the like the petals of a flower. The photo below was taken from above, we are looking down onto a waypoint, and you can see <span class= 
"style17">t<span>he colour of a Radius is Blue</span>, as you can see in the picture below.</span></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/wp10rads.jpg" alt="A waypoint and its radius indicators viewed from above" name="Waypoint radius" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">A Normal waypoint and its Radius indicators viewed from above.</p>
These <span class="style17">Radius</span> indicators are a great means to see how big the radius of a waypoint actually is, it ends exactly where the beams end.<br>
What does the <span class="style17">Radius</span> actually do? It tells the bots how exactly they must navigate around the waypoint in question. If a bot walks past a row of waypoints with big radii,
it will know that super-exact navigation is not required. If the radii are small, the bot will stick strictly to the waypoints.<br>
Thus, in open areas big radii help to make bot navigation natural - you wouldn't want to see a bot run across a wide courtyard as if it was following an incredibly thin, straight line painted onto
the ground, now, would you? It looks much more natural if the bot takes advantage of the space he has around him.<br>
However, in narrow corridors and doorways or on bridges, the situation is different, too big radii would make bots too careless, they would bump into walls or even fall off a bridge because they
think they can walk anywhere inside that big radius!<br>
That's why choosing appropriate waypoint radii is so important. As a general rule, keep the radii big in open areas and make them small in narrow passages. Read the following section to learn how:</p>
<span class="style2">Setting or Changing the Radius:</span> 

<p>The good news first: You don't have to set every single <span class="style17">Radius</span> manually, the editor will do much of the work for you! It will automatically calculate the <span class= 
"style17">Radius</span> of a waypoint depending on the area around it. If the editor detects higher (~more than knee-high) obstacles like walls nearby, it will automatically adjust the <span class= 
"style17">Radius</span> to reach up to the wall, not further. However, the maximum <span class="style17">Radius</span> is limited to 96 units. This means that even on a totally open plain, where the
nearest obstacle is hundreds of distance units away, the <span class="style17">Radius</span> will not exceed 96.<br>
<br>
 Now you might wonder &quot;Well, if the editor does all this for me, why would I change radii by hand?&quot; The answer is simple,the editor helps, but it isn't perfect, it cannot detect all kinds of
obstacles (I can't go too much into detail here because all this is pretty much map-related). Anyway, you will see places where the radius cuts into an obstacle - it could be a very thin pillar, a
fence, or even a solid-looking car that's parked in the streets... as I said, it depends on how the mapper built these elements.<br>
 Another problem is not with walls, but with holes and cliffs, If there is no high obstacle, the editor will regard an area as clear and set a big radius, it doesn't care if right next to the
waypoint there's a yawning abyss where bots will fall to death!<br>
 So these are areas where you will have to keep a watchful eye on your radii and if necessary, change them by hand. In narrow corridors and especially around narrow doorways, you will see that even a
small radius calculated by the editor doesn't make the bots navigate precisely enough. In such places, I strongly recommend lowering the radius to zero.<br>
 In order to change the radius of a waypoint, bring up the main menu and select &quot;<span class="style14">3. Set Radius</span>&quot;. The following menu will appear:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/men3wprd.jpg" alt="The radius menu" name="The radius menu" width="160" height="340" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">The Radius menu with all options between 0 and 112.</p>
<p>Simply select an option by pressing the corresponding key, and the radius of the currently active waypoint will be changed to the selected value. You will quickly get a feeling for these numbers
if you play around with them a bit.</p>

<span class="style2">Waypoints with fixed radii</span> 

<p><span class="style13">Note:</span> Some waypoint types will always have, and require, a radius of zero. The radii of thes waypoint types <span class="style13">should NOT be changed</span>! The
types with fixed radii are: <span class="style20">Ladder</span>, <span class="style16">Rescue</span>, <span class="style19">Camp</span> (no matter if team specific or not) and <span class="style23">
Map Goal</span>.</p>

<span class="style2">Connecting Waypoints:</span> 
<p>Waypoints alone aren't sufficient to make bots move the way you want. They must be connected with other waypoints in order to let bots reach their goal. By default, connections up to a certain
distance will be made automatically.<br>
 You can select the automatic connection distance (AutoPath Max Distance, APMD) by bringing up the main menu and selecting &quot;<span class="style14">9. Options</span>&quot;.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/men7wpop.jpg" alt="The options menu" name="The options menu" width="200" height="260" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">The Waypoint Options menu.</p>
<p>Now select the entry &quot;<span class="style14">6. AutoPath Max Distance</span>&quot;. The following sub-menu will appear:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/men8apmd.jpg" alt="The apmd menu" name="The apmd menu" width="200" height="260" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">The APMD (AutoPath Max Distance) menu.</p>
<p>Select the desired distance from this menu. After selecting a distance, connections up to that distance will be drawn automatically, of course, you can also add and remove connections manually.
However, this needs a little bit more explanation, and it's better to explain if you know the different connection types.<br>
So let's first have a look at these - afterwards you can read how to add and remove such connections by hand.</p>

<span class="style15">Two-way (bidirectional)</span> connections 
<p>The vast majority of all connections in a waypoint set will be <span class="style15">bidirectional</span>. Obviously, these connections enable bots to walk both from point A to point B and back
from point B to point A. <span class="style15">The colour of bidirectional paths is yellow</span>, as you can see in the picture below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/con1_2w.jpg" alt="A two-way connection" name="A two-way connection" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">A 2-Way connection between the two depicted waypoints.</p>

<span class="style16">One-way</span> connections 
<p><span class="style16">One-way connections</span> enable bots to walk from point A to point B, but not vice versa. They can be useful to make bots drop down a wall or a high crate, but prevent them
from attempting to get up. Of course, there may be more places at which a <span class="style16">1-way connection</span> can make sense, but that depends on the map.<br>
 In game, <span class="style16">1-way connections</span> will be visible from 2 waypoints, their start and their end waypoint. In order to show you the direction of <span class="style16">1-way
connection</span>, it will be shown in different colours depending on from which perspective you view it. Let's say you have a <span class="style16">1-way connection</span> from point 1 to point 2.
In this case, when you are standing at point 1, you will see <span class="style16">the outgoing 1-way connection displayed in white</span> as you can see in the picture below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/con2_1wo.jpg" alt="An outgoing one-way connection" name="Outgoing 1-way connection" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>

<p align="center" class="style11">An Outgoing 1-Way connection,<br>
 (A connection that leads FROM where i am standing TO the point in the background, but not back from it).</p>
<p>The picture below shows the same two waypoints and the same connection, but this time I took the screenshot while I was standing near the second waypoint.<span class="style24">The incoming 1-way
connection displayed in teal</span> as you can see in the picture below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/con3_1wi.jpg" alt="An incoming one-way connection" name="Incoming 1-way connection" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>

<p align="center" class="style11">An Incoming 1-Way connection<br>
 (A connection that leads FROM the point in the background TO the point where i'm standing).</p>
<p>The fact that <span class="style16">1-way connection</span> are shown from both involved points is a great feature. It makes spotting errors very easy and saves you the trouble of running around
to check if there is a connection TO the point where you are standing.</p>

<span class="style12">Jump</span> connections 
<p><span class="style12">Jump</span> connections are a bit special as they cannot be drawn like any other connection. But that's not all, apart from that, <span class="style12">Jump</span>
connections can also be <span class="style13">one-way or two-way connections</span>. To make matters even more complex, their 2-way version can come in two flavours: A &quot;pure&quot; two-way jump connection,
i.e. a <span class="style12">Jump</span> connection from A to B and another <span class="style12">Jump</span> connection back from B to A or a &quot;mixed&quot; two way connection, with a <span class=
"style12">Jump</span> connection leading from A to B and a regular one-way connection back from B to A. The latter version will be very rare, though. Now once again, this sounds more complicted than
it actually is.<br>
<span class="style12">The Jump connection horizontal line displayed in red(Outgoing Jump connection)</span>, viewed from the waypoints where the bots will start their jump can be seen in the picture
below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/con4_jo.jpg" alt="Outgoing jump connection" name="Outgoing jump connection" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>

<p align="center" class="style11">An Outgoing Jump connection, it will make bots jump to the waypoint in the background.</p>
<p>Here is the same connection viewed from the waypoint where bots will land after their jump. As you can see, it is shown as a <span class="style24">incoming 1-way connection (displayed in
teal)</span>. From this side, you cannot tell whether this incoming connection is a <span class="style12">Jump</span> connection or a <span class="style16">1-way outgoing connection</span>. Given the
fact that there's a gap where bots can fall down, it had better be a <span class="style12">Jump</span> connection... <span class="style14">;)</span></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/con5_ji.jpg" alt="Incoming jump connection" name="Incoming jump connection" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>

<p align="center" class="style11">An Incoming Jump connection, bots start their jump at the waypoint in the background and land here - hopefully.</p>
<p>Now look at the pprevious screenshot, I could add a regular <span class="style16">1-way connection</span> back to the waypoint in the background. (I know it wouldn't make sense at this spot, but
let's just pretend there were no gap between the waypoints.)<br>
 After making this connection, the connection line would turn into a <span class="style15">Two-way connection</span> when viewed from the position shown in the screenshot. It will show you that
there's a way to get TO the waypoint in the background and back FROM it. At the same time, you will know that bots will walk back to the waypoint in the background. Why?<br>
 Because a &quot;pure&quot; <span class="style12">2-way Jump connection shows as a red line</span> from both sides. If i added a jump back from the point where I took the screenshot to the point in the
background, the connection would show as a red line, no matter from which of the two waypoints I look at it. This will tell you that bots will jump between the two waypoints, no matter in which
direction they are following the connection.</p>

<span class="style2">Adding/ Removing connections manually and Special Cases</span> 

<p>Now you know the most important things about connections in general and the different types of connections. You also know how to adjust automatic connection lengths and how to add a jump
connection by hand. But how do you add or remove a connection by hand?<br>
 In older PODBot versions, you could add and remove connections by means of console commands. You will be glad to hear that PODBot MM uses a much more comfortable method to accomplish this. You
simply aim at the desired waypoint and select the action to perform from the on-screen menu!</p>

<p>Here's how it works (Look at the screenshot below), let's pretend we wanted to delete the connection from the waypoint where we're standing to the left waypoint near the wall, aim at the waypoint
with your crosshair. As soon as the waypoint is selected, it will become bigger, and a little blue cross will appear on top of it.</p>

<p><span class="style13">NOTE 1:</span> This only works if you are standing near a waypoint and aiming at another one! If you are standing in a waypointless area, you won't be able to use this
function because it needs two selected waypoints (The one where you are standing and the one you are aiming at).<br>
<span class="style13">NOTE 2:</span> You can override whatever Apmd value with manual connections, but there's a limit of 500 units.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/con6aim1.jpg" alt="Aiming at waypoints" name="Aiming at waypoints" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>

<p align="center" class="style11">The left waypoint is selected, although the crosshair isn't exactly on it.<br>
<span class="style11">Note how big it is in comparison to the other, unselected waypoint! Besides, you can see the blue cross on top.</span></p>
<p>You will see that the crosshair doesn't have to be exactly on the waypoint, it's usually enough if you aim somewhere near the point. Sometimes you will even have to aim a little bit away from the
waypoint in order to activate it. Simply move your crosshair around the waypoint until you see that it gets bigger and has the blue cross on top of it. Leave the crosshair where it is and perform
whatever action you want to perform.</p>
<p>If you have problems activating a waypoint, you can also try changing your position a bit, Walk a step forward or to the side, aim at the desired waypoint from a slightly different angle. You will
get a feeling for it quickly!<br>
 The following picture demonstrates some of the peculiarities of this aiming system, especially over longer distances. The crosshair is actually nearer to the right camp waypoint in the background,
but nonetheless, the left one is selected!</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/con7aim2.jpg" alt="Aiming over long distances 1" name="Aiming over long distances 1" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>

<p align="center" class="style11">Despite the crosshair being nearer to the right waypoint, the left one is selected!</p>

<p>In the screenshot below, I stood at the exact same position and aimed until I had the right waypoint activated. As you can see that the crosshair is off to the right quite a bit. But you can also
see how well the activated waypoint is visible even from such a large distance. Normally it would be even slightly thinner than the left waypoint, as it is a little further away. But here it is nice
and fat, easy to tell apart from unselected waypoints.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/con8aim3.jpg" alt="Aiming over long distances 2" name="Aiming over long distances 2" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>

<p align="center" class="style11">Now aiming at the right waypoint, the crosshair is a bit off, but the waypoint is selected.</p>

<p>Now you know how to activate a waypoint by aiming at it. In order to add a connection now, bring up the main menu and select &quot;<span class="style14">6. Add Path</span>&quot;. The following sub-menu will
appear:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/men6addp.jpg" alt="Add Path menu" name="Add Path menu" width="200" height="200" border="0" ></p>

<p align="center" class="style11">The &quot;Add Path&quot; menu where you can select which type of connection to add.</p>
<p>Well, this is almost self-explanatory, Select the connection type you want to add, and it will be drawn. You have read about the available connection types above, so this should be no problem.<br>
&quot;<span class="style16">Outgoing path</span>&quot; means a <span class="style16">1-way connection</span> going from your current position to the waypoint you're aiming at.<br>
&quot;<span class="style19">Incoming path</span>&quot; means the opposite, a <span class="style24">1-way connection</span> coming towards your position from the waypoint you're aiming at.<br>
&quot;<span class="style15">Bi-directional (Both ways)</span>&quot; means obivously a <span class="style15">Two-way connection</span><br>
 <span class="style13">Note:</span> Jump connections can only be drawn by performing the jump, that's why this connection type is not available in this menu.</p>

<p>Removing connection manually is even easier, but works slightly different because you don't have to choose what to remove. Just aim at a waypoint and select &quot;<span class="style14">6. Delete
Path</span>&quot; from the waypointing menu.<br>
 If there is a 1-way connection (<span class="style24">Incoming</span> or <span class="style16">Outgoing</span>) between the waypoint where you are standing and the waypoint you are aiming at, it
will be deleted.<br>
 If there is a <span class="style15">2-way connection</span> between the two waypoints, selecting &quot;<span class="style14">6. Delete Path</span>&quot; will first delete the connection that leads from your
position to the other waypoint. Thus, a <span class="style24">1-way connection</span> from the waypoint you are aiming at back to your own position will remain. Simply hit &quot;<span class="style14">6.
Delete Path</span>&quot; again, and it will disappear.</p>

Special cases: Adding connections with the waypoint cache function 

<p>In some cases, especially with <span class="style20">Ladder</span> waypoints, you may run into serious problems to aim at a waypoint. Let's say you want to connect two <span class="style20">
Ladder</span> waypoints. You're standing at the lower end of the ladder, but you just can't get the upper ladder waypoint activated. In such a case, simply bring up the waypointing menu and select
&quot;<span class="style14">9. Options</span>&quot;.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/men7wpop.jpg" alt="The options menu" name="The options menu" width="200" height="260" border="0" ></p>

<p align="center" class="style11">The Waypoint Options menu.</p>
<p>Select &quot;<span class="style14">7. Cache this Waypoint</span>&quot;. You will see a message on your HUD: &quot;Waypoint #node has been put into memory&quot;, where &quot;node&quot; is the number of the waypoint you're
standing at.<br>
<span class="style13">Note:</span> As soon as a waypoint has been put into the cache, all manual connection adding/removing actions will affect the cached waypoint, no matter how far you are away! So
be careful with this function. If you put a waypoint into the cache, then walk to the other side of the map and manually add a connection somewhere, the connection will lead to the cached waypoint,
even if this means going through the entire map and thick walls!</p>

<p>But back to the example: You are still standing at the lower ladder waypoint and have just cached it. Now you can climb up to the upper ladder waypoint and add a <span class="style15">2-way
connection</span>. This new <span class="style15">2-way connection</span> will automatically be made between your current position (the upper ladder waypoint) and the cached waypoint (in this case,
the lower ladder waypoint).<br>
 In order to clear the cache, simply walk to any point in the map where there is no waypoint nearby. Then, select &quot;<span class="style14">7. Cache this Waypoint</span>&quot; again. You will see a HUD
message: &quot;Cache cleared! (no waypoint nearby)&quot;. Now the cache is empty, and you can continue working just like before.<br>
 <span class="style13">HINT:</span> As I mentioned, this function can cause errors if you don't pay attention to what you are doing. Therefore, I recommend clearing the cache immediately as soon as
you don't need it anymore.</p>

<span class="style2">Waypoint Flags</span> 

<p>Waypoint flags are anything that makes a waypoint &quot;behave&quot; in a special way and serve for more (or different) things than mere navigation purposes.<br>
 Flags can be divided into two categories, and if you wanted to invent some nice names for these categories, you could call them exclusive and cumulative flags.<br>
 What does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, exclusive flags are flags that exclude each other - a waypoint carries EITHER one flag OR another, but never two at the same time. Such a flag will change the type of a waypoint. For
example, if you have a <span class="style18">Normal</span> waypoint and add a &quot;<span class="style14">6. Rescue</span>&quot; flag to it, the waypoint will turn into a <span class="style16">Rescue</span>
waypoint, with all its functions. It cannot be a <span class="style18">Normal</span> waypoint AND a <span class="style16">Rescue</span> waypoint at the same time.<br>
 The following flags are exclusive: <span class="style23">Map Goal</span>, <span class="style20">Ladder</span>, <span class="style16">Rescue</span>, <span class="style19">Camp</span> and Team
Specific (<span class="style17">CT</span> or <span class="style12">T</span>)*. Adding one of these flags to any waypoint will turn it into the selected waypoint type.<br>
 <span class="style13">Note:</span> Team Specific is really a special case, because with <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoints, it's cumulative - but with all others, it's exclusive.</p>
<p>Cumulative flags are flags that don't exclude each other, i.e. a waypoint can carry one of these flags AND a another one at the same time. For example, a waypoint can be Team Specific (<span
class="style17">CT</span> or <span class="style12">T</span>) AND carry a <span class="style18">Button</span> flag at the same time. It can mark a strategically important position for one of the teams
and at the same time tell all bots to push a nearby button.<br>
 The following flags are cumulative: <span class="style18">Button</span>, Lift, <span class="style21">Crouch</span> and <span class="style12">No Hostage</span> and Team Specific (<span class=
"style17">CT</span> or <span class="style12">T</span>)*.Adding one of these flags to any waypoint will also mark it into the selected waypoint type including what type it was before.<span class= 
"style13"><br>
 Note:</span> Team Specific is only cumulative when applied to <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoints.</p>

<p>Bring up the main menu and select &quot;<span class="style14">4. Set Flags</span> &quot;. The following sub-menu will appear:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/men4wpfl.jpg" alt="The waypoint flags menu" name="The waypoint flags menu" width="160" height="340" border="0" ></p>

<p align="center" class="style11">The Waypoint Flags menu.</p>
<p>The following list will show the effects of each flag in detail:</p>

<p><span class="style18">Use Button</span> (cumulative)</p>
<p>This flag will tell bots that they need to push a nearby button every time they come past the flagged waypoint. You can add this flag to any waypoint type. This flag is not necessary for
button-triggered doors, because bots that are about to go through a closed button-triggered door will &quot;see&quot; that their path is blocked and automatically look for the button that opens the door.
However, there might be situations where the bots can't detect an obstacle in their path but still need to push a button in order to reach their goal. Imagine a deadly laser beam that can be
temporally deactivated with a button, for example. Bots won't be able to detect the laser beam as an obstacle and thus ignore the button and die. But if you add a button flag to the waypoint next to
the deactivator button, all bots will be forced to push the button before they continue.<span class="style18">The Use Button is shown as a little green cross near the top of a waypoint</span> as you
can see in the picture below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/fl2buttn.jpg" alt="A button flag on a normal waypoint" name="A button flag" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">This Normal waypoint is marked with a Button Flag.</p>

<p><span class="style18">Lift</span> (cumulative)</p>
<p>You won't be too surprised to read that a Lift flag is used to enable bots to use lifts. Lift flags must be applied to the waypoint inside an elevator shaft. Imagine a normal elevator that can
move between ground level and 1st floor. You will have one waypoint inside the elvator cabin at ground level, and another one you added inside the elevator cabin when you were at the 1st floor. Both
waypoints will be connected to each other. If there were no connection, bots wouldn't know that one possible path to get from one storey to the other leads through the elevator. Now the problem is
that bots are supposed to hit the button, walk into the elevator, stand still until they have reached the other storey and walk out of the elevator. This is where the Lift flags are needed: They tell
your bots to hold their position until the elevator has reached the other storey.<br>
 Lift flags are visualized like use_button flag, but instead green color You can see the same in pink color.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/fl3lift.jpg" alt="A lift flag on a normal waypoint" name="A lift flag" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">This Normal waypoint is marked with a Lift Flag.</p>

<p><span class="style18">Crouch</span> (cumulative)</p>
<p>Adding this flag to a waypoint will not change the waypoint type (e.g. <span class="style18">Normal</span>, <span class="style23">Goal</span>, <span class="style20">Ladder</span> etc.), but it
will make the selected waypoint a Crouched waypoint. You will see the effect when you look at the waypoint to which you applied the flag. I.e. It will be smaller, just as if you had made it a
Crouched waypoint in the first place.<br>
However, I recommend placing Crouched waypoints the normal way instead of adding a Crouch flag to standing waypoints. It's taking two steps where only one step is necessary, and besides, if you add
the Crouch flag to a standing waypoint, the waypoint will float in the air several inches above the ground.</p>

<span class="style23">Map Goal</span> (exclusive) 
<p>This flag will turn any waypoint into a <span class="style23">Map Goal</span> waypoint. It can be quite useful if you waypointed the area around the map goal with <span class="style18">
Normal</span> waypoints and then realized that you would rather have a <span class="style23">Map Goal</span> waypoint in place of one of the <span class="style18">Normal</span> waypoints. Instead of
deleting the <span class="style18">Normal</span> waypoint and inserting a <span class="style23">Map Goal</span> waypoint, you can just use this flag.</p>

<span class="style20">Ladder</span> (exclusive) 
<p>A <span class="style20">Ladder</span> flag will obviously turn the waypoint it's applied to into a <span class="style20">Ladder</span> waypoint. If you accidentally added a <span class="style18">
Normal</span> waypoint where there should be a <span class="style20">Ladder</span> waypoint (for example when jumping to a ladder), this flag can come in handy.</p>

<span class="style16">Rescue</span> (exclusive) 
<p>Forgot to add a <span class="style16">Rescue</span> waypoint in the rescue zone? There are already so many waypoint around that you don't want to add yet another one? Well, this flag will turn any
waypoint into a <span class="style16">Rescue</span> waypoint. Also handy when your <span class="style16">Rescue</span> waypoint isn't far enough in the rescue zone that bot's only rescue half the
hostages and run back to the enemies with the hostages tagging along. Just make your previous <span class="style16">Rescue</span> waypoint into a <span class="style18">Normal</span> and change
another <span class="style18">Normal</span> deeper in the zone to a <span class="style16">Rescue</span></p>

<span class="style19">Camp</span> (exclusive) 
<p>This flag will turn any waypoint into a <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoint. Right after adding the flag, however, this freshly made <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoint will not have
its <span class="style15">Camp start</span> and <span class="style21">Camp end</span> markers correctly set. You must do so manually by selecting &quot;<span class="style14">6. Camp start</span>&quot; and
&quot;<span class="style14">7. Camp end</span>&quot; from the &quot;<span class="style14">1. Add</span>&quot; menu, just as you'd do with any <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoint.</p>

<span class="style12">No Hostage</span> (cumulative) 
<p>This flag is only needed on CS-maps, but there it's absolutely <span class="style13">important</span>! It will block a waypoint for a <span class="style17">CT</span> bot that's leading hostages
towards the rescue zone. By using this flag you can prevent bots from choosing paths where the hostages cannot follow them (up a ladder or through a narrow vent, for example). The &quot;<span class= 
"style14">8. No Hostage</span>&quot; flag must be applied to the first waypoint that should <span class="style13">NOT</span> be reached with hostages. In order to make it easier for you to keep an
overview over which point are blocked and which aren't, <span class="style12">the No Hostage is shown as a little red cross near the top of a waypoint</span> as you can see in the picture below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/fl1nohos.jpg" alt="A no hostage flag on a normal waypoint" name="A no hostage flag" width="480" height="360" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">This Normal waypoint carries a No Hostage Flag. Counter-Terrorists bots with hostages won't be able to use it.</p>
Team Specific (cumulative with <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoints, else exclusive) 

<p>Upon selecting this flag, you will be prompted with a sub-menu where you can choose for which of the two teams the waypoint will be specific.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/men5tmsp.jpg" alt="Sub-menu for team-specific flag" name="Sub-meu for team-specific flag" width="200" height="200" border="0" ></p>
<p align="center" class="style11">This menu will appear when you select the flag &quot;Team Specific&quot;.</p>
<p>When applied to <span class="style18">Normal</span>, <span class="style20">Ladder</span>, <span class="style16">Rescue</span> or <span class="style23">Map Goal</span> waypoints, this flag will turn the waypoint into a Team Specific one. A <span class="style17">Counter-Terrorist Important</span> waypoint if you selected &quot;<span class="style14">2.
Counter-Terrorists</span>&quot; and a <span class="style12">Terrorist Important</span> one if you selected &quot;<span class="style14">1. Terrorists</span>&quot;.</p>
<p>With <span class="style17">CT</span> and <span class="style12">T</span> Important points, you can use this flag to change the team the waypoint is associated with. For example, you can use it to turn a <span class="style17">CT</span> Important waypoint into a <span class="style12">T</span> Important one. If you
select the third option, &quot;<span class="style14">3. Both Teams</span>&quot;, you can turn any <span class="style17">CT</span> or <span class="style17">T</span> Important waypoint into a <span class="style18">Normal</span> waypoint.</p>
<p>With <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoints, however, this flag works a bit differently. You can add it to any <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoint to turn it into a Team Specific Camp waypoint. Only bots of the associated team will be allowed
to camp there. Of course, you can also change a Team Specific Camp waypoint back to a normal <span class="style19">Camp</span> waypoint by selecting the third option &quot;<span class="style14">3. Both Teams</span>&quot;.</p>

<p>So there you go, that covers everything you need to know about waypoints, paths connections, radii, waypoint flags, in order to waypoint a map and some nice little tips and tricks you can use. But there's one more thing you need to read before you start making a name for yourself in the world of waypointing, the next part contains some breifing on the common errors new waypointers make as well as some more tips and tricks to help you become a pro waypointer faster, like using bindings instead of menu's. </p>
