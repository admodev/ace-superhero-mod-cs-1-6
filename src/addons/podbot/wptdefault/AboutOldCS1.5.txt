Waypoints by SoUlFaThEr & T Wrecks for PODbot mm (a metamod plugin).

Place all .pwf files in your "addons\podbot\WPTDefault" folder.

If you are playing this bot on old CS 1.5 You will need to NOT add 4 files to 
the WPTDefault folder:
de_aztec.pwf, de_cbble.pwf, de_inferno.pwf, and de_piranesi.pwf because these only 
work for CS 1.6.

The files named de_aztec(CS 1.5).pwf, de_cbble(CS 1.5).pwf, de_inferno(CS 1.5).pwf, and 
de_piranesi(CS 1.5).pwf are the ones you need for old CS1.5. These maps were changed 
for CS1.6 Steam!!!!!

You will need to rename these, taking out the (CS 1.5). Once that is done,
all maps will work with the waypoints given.

Have fun.
